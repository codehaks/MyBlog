About 3 days ago the final version of ASP Core 2.0 released. I installed the new bits and have been playing with it since. here is my experience so far. Fantastic.

## No bugs

So far I experienced no bugs. Everything works perfectly. No compatibility issues like the previews version and no errors. Its fast and reliable.

## .Net Standard 2.0

Its really the best part of the new version. it feels more matured than the last version. supporting a large number of older libraries is really what many developers were looking for.

## Configuration and Logging as a service

With IConfiguration And ILoggerFactory injected directly into Services
its now accessible from every where in project without any additional code.

## Razor pages

I always needed this feature. In very projects there is some simple pages that dont have any code behind. And even they do, its almost nothing. now I dont have to create a Model, Controller and View just to show about page. and thats my favorite thing in ASP Core 2.0

## Conclusion

Until last week I was not even considering migrating to ASP Core. Because there were so many uncertainties around the project and there were not much to gain after all.
But now I feel like I can not go back and use the old ASP MVC 5 any more ! yes, It's that good.
